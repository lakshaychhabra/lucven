# The Tokenization Papers: Why 90% of LLM Failures Start Here

## The Hidden Layer That Controls Everything

Every prompt you send to GPT, Claude, or Gemini gets shredded into tokens before the model even "thinks." These aren't words — they're **compression artifacts from 2021 web crawls** that now dictate:
- **Your API bill** (why Hindi costs 17x more than English)
- **Your model's IQ** (why it thinks 9.11 > 9.9)
- **Your RAG accuracy** (why $AAPL returns articles about Polish batteries)

Tokenization is the silent killer of production AI systems. These papers expose the disasters hiding in plain sight.

## The Papers

### 1. [The Colonial Tax: Why Non-English Users Pay 17x More](/posts/tokenization/byte-level-tokenizer/)
Hindi text uses 17x more tokens. Arabic hits context limits 8x faster. Chinese users burn through budgets 5x quicker. Your "multilingual" model is financially punishing 80% of the world — and you're losing customers because of compression algorithms from 2019.

### 2. [Tokenization Forensics: Finding Training Data Leaks](/posts/tokenization/forensics/)
Single tokens like `SolidGoldMagikarp` are smoking guns proving your data was in the training set. Learn how tokenizers accidentally become forensic tools that expose what models were trained on — including your proprietary code.

### 3. [Numbers Are Broken: Why LLMs Think 9.11 > 9.9](/posts/tokenization/tokenization_math/)
Your model isn't bad at math — it literally sees different numbers than you do. "2024" is one token, "2025" is two tokens, "1234" doesn't exist. Watch tokenization murder arithmetic, dates, and any hope of numerical reasoning.

### 4. [One Space Changes Everything: Tokenization as Mind Control](/posts/tokenization/tokenization_personality_trigger/)
`"Hello"` makes a helpful assistant. `" Hello"` (with a leading space) triggers aggressive responses. `"HELLO"` changes the entire personality. Invisible tokenization boundaries are controlling your model's behavior — and you don't even know it.

### 5. [What Tokens Actually Are (Spoiler: Not Words)](/posts/tokenization/what_are_tokens/)
Tokens are byte-pair frequency hacks from random internet text. A hyphen, a capital letter, or a Unicode variant can 10x your costs. This paper explains why tokens exist, how they're built, and why they're breaking your system.

### 6. [Your $50K Vector Database Thinks $AAPL = Polish Batteries](/posts/tokenization/tokenisation_limits/)
When "$AAPL" tokenizes as ["$", "AA", "PL"], your embeddings combine "currency" + "batteries" + "Poland". Your semantic search for "Apple stock" returns nonsense because tokenization murdered meaning before embeddings even had a chance.

### 7. [Why Your Model Can't Learn Your Concepts (Even After 50K Examples)](//posts/tokenization/learning_new_concepts/)
You annotated 50,000 examples of "TurboIN" but your model still thinks it's about turbochargers in Indiana. The embedding space was frozen at pretraining — you're teaching patterns, not concepts. Here's what actually works.

### 8. [Hidden Tokenization Bombs: The Disasters Nobody Talks About](/posts/tokenization/gems/)
- "therapist" vs "the rapist" with invisible Unicode
- Medical apps failing because μg ≠ µg (different Unicode)
- French "pain" (bread) neurons firing in English medical text
- How fine-tuning "$AAPL" breaks currency processing globally

### 9. [The $10M Question: Should You Train Your Own Tokenizer?](/posts/tokenization/training/)
**Spoiler: No.** Unless you're Google, you're better off with 500 lines of preprocessing. BioBERT spent millions on medical tokenization and still fragments "Immunoglobulin" into 7 pieces. Here's the decision tree that saves you from bankruptcy.
