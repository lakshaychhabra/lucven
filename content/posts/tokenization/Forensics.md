# Tokenization Leaks the Training Set (The Forensics Goldmine)

Want to know if GPT-4 was trained on your company's leaked data? Check if your internal codenames are single tokens. Want to detect if a model saw specific Reddit posts? The tokenizer already told you.

> **TL;DR**: Tokenizers are accidental forensic evidence. If `SolidGoldMagikarp` is a single token, that string appeared thousands of times in training. This is how researchers discovered GPT models trained on specific Reddit users, leaked databases, and private codebases.

## The Smoking Gun Test

```python
# Test if a model was trained on specific data:
def training_set_forensics(tokenizer, test_strings):
    """Detect what the model likely saw during training"""
    
    results = {}
    for string in test_strings:
        tokens = tokenizer.encode(string)
        decoded = [tokenizer.decode([t]) for t in tokens]
        
        # Single token = appeared frequently in training
        # Many tokens = rare or unseen
        if len(tokens) == 1:
            status = "🔴 DEFINITELY in training (1000s of times)"
        elif len(tokens) == 2:
            status = "🟡 Likely in training (100s of times)"
        elif len(tokens) <= len(string)/4:
            status = "🟢 Possibly in training"
        else:
            status = "⚪ Probably NOT in training"
        
        results[string] = {
            'tokens': len(tokens),
            'pieces': decoded,
            'status': status
        }
    
    return results

# Try these:
suspicious_strings = [
    "$AAPL",           # Apple stock
    "$TSLA",           # Tesla stock  
    "$GME",            # GameStop (meme stock)
    "SolidGoldMagikarp",  # Reddit username
    "petertodd",       # Bitcoin developer
    " davidjl123",     # Another Reddit user
    "TheNitromeFan",   # Counting subreddit user
    "<|endoftext|>",   # GPT special token
    "REDACTED_EMAIL",  # Your company's placeholder?
]

results = training_set_forensics(tokenizer, suspicious_strings)
```

## The Reddit Conspiracy (It's Real)

```python
# These are ACTUAL single tokens in GPT tokenizers:
weird_tokens = {
    "SolidGoldMagikarp": 1,  # Reddit user with 100K+ comments
    " petertodd": 1,          # Bitcoin developer mentioned everywhere
    "TheNitromeFan": 1,       # Power user in r/counting
    " davidjl123": 1,         # Another counting enthusiast
    "cloneembryos": 1,        # WTF? Specific subreddit discussions
    " guiActiveUn": 1,        # Unity game engine internal variable
    " TPPStreamerBot": 1,     # Twitch Plays Pokemon bot
}

# Why does this matter?
# 1. These users' writing styles are BAKED into the model
# 2. Prompting with these tokens triggers specific behaviors
# 3. It's proof of training on Reddit data through 2021
```

## The Domain Detector

```python
# Compare tokenizers to detect training bias:

def compare_domain_coverage(text, tokenizers_dict):
    """See which model knows your domain best"""
    
    print(f"Testing: '{text}'")
    print("-" * 50)
    
    best_score = float('inf')
    best_model = None
    
    for name, tokenizer in tokenizers_dict.items():
        tokens = tokenizer.encode(text)
        decoded = [tokenizer.decode([t]) for t in tokens]
        
        print(f"{name:15} → {len(tokens)} tokens: {decoded}")
        
        if len(tokens) < best_score:
            best_score = len(tokens)
            best_model = name
    
    print(f"\n🏆 {best_model} knows this domain best!")
    return best_model

# Real examples:
finance_test = "$NVDA earnings beat expectations Q4"
crypto_test = "dogecoin hodl moon lambo wen"
medical_test = "acetaminophen hepatotoxicity cirrhosis"
gaming_test = "speedrun any% glitchless PB WR"

# Results reveal training data:
# GPT-4: Good at finance (WSB in training)
# Claude: Better at medical (PubMed heavy)
# LLaMA: Gaming terms fragmented (less Reddit)
```

## The Corporate Leak Detector

```python
# Check if your company's data leaked into training:

company_indicators = [
    # Your internal codenames
    "Project_Phantom",
    "PROD_API_KEY_V2",
    "TODO_FIXME_HACK",
    
    # Your employee usernames
    "jsmith@yourcompany",
    "jenkins-bot-prod",
    
    # Your internal URLs
    "internal.yourcompany.com",
    "staging-server-2",
    
    # Your error messages
    "Error: Database connection failed (YourCompany v2.3.1)",
]

for indicator in company_indicators:
    tokens = tokenizer.encode(indicator)
    if len(tokens) <= 3:  # Suspiciously efficient
        print(f"⚠️ ALERT: '{indicator}' is {len(tokens)} tokens!")
        print(f"This string likely appeared in training data!")
```

## The Easter Egg Hunt (Glitch Tokens)

```python
# Some tokens cause BIZARRE behavior when used as prompts:

glitch_tokens = {
    "SolidGoldMagikarp": "Causes hallucinations about goldfish",
    " petertodd": "Triggers Bitcoin discussions",
    "〉〈": "Makes models output broken HTML",
    " Leilan": "Triggers anime/mythology crossover",
    "PsyNetMessage": "Outputs Rocket League error messages",
    " embedreportprint": "Triggers debug output",
    " guiActiveUn": "Outputs Unity Engine internals",
}

# Try this (at your own risk):
# prompt = "Tell me about SolidGoldMagikarp"
# Models often respond with nonsense about goldfish, magic, or Reddit

# WHY THIS HAPPENS:
# 1. Token appears thousands of times in specific context
# 2. Model memorizes the pattern around it
# 3. Token becomes a "trigger" for that context
# 4. Using it alone causes context confusion
```

## The Stock Market Tell

```python
# Financial bias detection:

stocks = ["$AAPL", "$GOOGL", "$TSLA", "$GME", "$AMC", "$BBBY", "$PLTR"]

for stock in stocks:
    tokens = len(tokenizer.encode(stock))
    
    if tokens == 1:
        print(f"{stock}: 📈 Meme stock or high-frequency in training")
    elif tokens == 2:
        print(f"{stock}: 📊 Common stock in financial data")
    else:
        print(f"{stock}: 📉 Rare in training data")

# GPT models: $GME is often 1-2 tokens (WSB influence)
# Claude: $GME is 3-4 tokens (less meme stock training)

# This reveals:
# - GPT saw tons of WallStreetBets data
# - Claude focused more on traditional finance
# - Training cutoff dates (pre/post meme stock era)
```

## The Privacy Nightmare

```python
def check_pii_leakage(tokenizer, email_patterns):
    """Check if specific emails/usernames are in training"""
    
    concerning = []
    
    for email in email_patterns:
        tokens = tokenizer.encode(email)
        
        # If an email is <5 tokens, it appeared A LOT
        if len(tokens) < 5:
            concerning.append({
                'email': email,
                'tokens': len(tokens),
                'risk': 'HIGH - Likely memorized'
            })
    
    return concerning

# Real researcher findings:
leaked_emails = [
    "support@company.com",  # 2 tokens - appeared thousands of times
    "john.doe.1234@gmail",  # 8 tokens - probably safe
    "ceo@fortune500.com",   # 3 tokens - concerning!
]

# Researchers found actual email addresses as single tokens
# meaning they appeared THOUSANDS of times in training
```

## How to Exploit This (Ethically)

```python
class TokenizerForensics:
    """Use tokenization to understand model capabilities"""
    
    def detect_programming_languages(self, tokenizer):
        """Which languages did it see most?"""
        
        code_snippets = {
            'Python': 'def __init__(self):',
            'JavaScript': 'const async = await',
            'Rust': 'fn main() -> Result<>',
            'Go': 'func (r *Reader) Read()',
            'COBOL': 'IDENTIFICATION DIVISION',
        }
        
        for lang, snippet in code_snippets.items():
            tokens = len(tokenizer.encode(snippet))
            efficiency = len(snippet) / tokens
            
            if efficiency > 10:
                print(f"{lang}: Heavily trained on this")
            elif efficiency > 5:
                print(f"{lang}: Moderate training")
            else:
                print(f"{lang}: Minimal training")
    
    def detect_website_training(self, tokenizer):
        """Which websites were scraped?"""
        
        sites = [
            "reddit.com/r/",
            "stackoverflow.com/questions/",
            "github.com/",
            "arxiv.org/abs/",
            "medium.com/@",
            "substack.com/p/",
        ]
        
        for site in sites:
            tokens = len(tokenizer.encode(site))
            if tokens <= 3:
                print(f"✓ {site} - Heavily scraped")
            else:
                print(f"✗ {site} - Lightly scraped")
```

## The Uncomfortable Implications

1. **Your Reddit posts are tokens**: Specific users' entire post histories are compressed into the model

2. **Corporate leaks are detectable**: Internal codenames as single tokens = data breach

3. **Model capabilities are predictable**: Bad tokenization = bad performance in that domain

4. **Privacy is already broken**: Email addresses, usernames, and phone numbers exist as tokens

5. **Temporal information leaks**: Token efficiency reveals WHEN data was collected

---

> **💡 Action Item**: Run `training_set_forensics()` on your company's internal terminology. If anything is ≤3 tokens, you might have a leak. Check your competitor's terminology too, you might discover their training data sources.

---

**Takeaway:** Tokenizers are inadvertent forensic evidence. Every merge decision is a fossil record of the training data. Single tokens for usernames, stock symbols, or internal codenames aren't bugs, they're proof of what the model memorized. Use this for good (detecting capabilities) or evil (finding leaks), but know that the tokenizer already spilled the secrets.
