# Lucven — A Blog by Lakshay Chhabra

Welcome to [Lucven.com](https://lucven.com) — a personal blog exploring:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Machine Learning systems and embeddings
- AI infrastructure and real-world deployment learnings

This is where I document hard-earned lessons, deep experiments, and insights that don’t make it to Twitter threads or conference papers.

If you work on production AI systems, RAG pipelines, or scalable ML infra—you’ll find things here that go beyond surface-level tutorials.

## ✍️ Topics I Write About

- How to chunk documents for better retrieval
- Dense vs sparse embeddings (BGE, SPLADE, OpenAI, custom)
- Hybrid search done right (and wrong)
- When not to use RAG
- Evaluation metrics: recall@k, faithfulness, hallucination rate
- Real issues in deploying RAG at scale
